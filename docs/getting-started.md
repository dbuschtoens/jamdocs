## Branch A

## Local installation

Even though Jamdocs is so simple, you dont really need to set it up localy (you could just fork it on github to edit styles and md-files) - if you want to change it up a bit I recommend setting up localy for a better developer experience.

To set up a new instance of Jamdocs, and start developing just clone the project from Github like, go to the directory and run gridsome:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/samuelhorn/jamdocs project-name
cd project-name
gridsome develop
```
